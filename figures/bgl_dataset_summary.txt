BGL DATASET SUMMARY FOR THESIS
================================================================================

1. DATASET OVERVIEW
    - Source: BlueGene/L supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Labs
    - System: 131,072 processors, 32,768GB memory
    - Raw logs: 4,747,963 lines
    - Preprocessing: Drain3 parser + sliding window (size=20)

2. SEQUENCE STATISTICS
    - Total sequences: 949,589
    - Normal sequences: 868,556 (91.47%)
    - Anomaly sequences: 81,033 (8.53%)
    - Anomaly rate: 8.53%

3. TEMPLATE STATISTICS
    - Total templates discovered: 369
    - Vocabulary size: 371
    - Template diversity: HIGH (compared to HDFS's 29 templates)

4. SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS
    - Fixed window size: 20 events
    - Sequence length (excluding padding):
    * Mean: 20.00
    * Median: 20
    * Std: 0.00
    * Range: [20, 20]

    - Event diversity (unique events per sequence):
    * Overall mean: 1.41
    * Normal mean: 1.40
    * Anomaly mean: 1.60

    - Event repetition ratio (length / unique events):
    * Normal mean: 17.37
    * Anomaly mean: 17.24

5. EVENT STATISTICS
    - Total events (tokens): 18,991,780
    - Unique events used: 370
    - Events in normal sequences: 17,371,120
    - Events in anomaly sequences: 1,620,660

6. KEY INSIGHTS
    - More complex system: 369 templates (vs 29 in HDFS)
    - Better class balance: 853.35% anomalies (vs 2.93% in HDFS)
    - Fixed-length sequences simplify sequential modeling
    - Larger vocabulary requires more embedding capacity
    - More training data available (949,589 sequences)
